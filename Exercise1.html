    Driving down the interstate
    I never felt so far away
    Leaving hardly hurts at all
    I'm sorry that I never call
    Often, I get exhausted
    Trying regardless to be enough
    Is it selfish not to be selfless
    When all I can help is to open up?</center></i></pre> 
<pre style="font-family:Tahoma; color:red;font-size:3pt"><u><left>
I'll be better than I was before
espite every text of yours ignored
Will you call me still?
Just to hear my voice, I swear
Always, I'll care
I'll care
</u></left></pre>
<pre style="font-family:Chiller; color:green;font-size:5pt"><b><i><center>
    Flipping through our photographs
    Those moments never seem to last
    Listening to self control
    There's feelings that you'll never know</center></b></i></pre>
<pre style="font-family:Harrington; color:orange; text-align:right;font-size:4pt"><u><i>
Leave me, it's never easy
I've had a lifetime to be alone
If you let me
When it gets heavy
No, I'll never let you be all alone </pre></u></i>
<pre style="font-family:Forte; color:yellow; text-align:center;font-size:4pt"><b><i><u>
I'll be better than I was before
Despite every text of yours ignored
Will you call me still?
Just to hear my voice, I swear
Always
Always
Always, I'll care
