What is smartphone addiction?While a smartphone, tablet, or computer can be a hugely productive tool, compulsive use of 
these devices can interfere with work, school, and relationships. 
When you spend more time on social media or playing games than you do interacting with real people, or you can’t stop yourself from 
repeatedly checking texts, emails, or apps—even when it has negative consequences in your life—it may be time to reassess your technology use.</pre>
<pre>Causes and effects of smartphone and Internet addiction
While you can experience impulse-control problems with a laptop or desktop computer, the size and convenience of smartphones and tablets
means that we can take them just about anywhere and gratify our compulsions at any time. In fact, most of us are rarely ever more than
five feet from our smartphones. Like the use of drugs and alcohol, they can trigger the release of the brain chemical dopamine and alter 
your mood. You can also rapidly build up tolerance so that it takes more and more time in front of these screens to derive the same pleasurable reward.
Heavy smartphone use can often be symptomatic of other underlying problems, such as stress, anxiety, depression, or loneliness. At the same time,
it can also exacerbate these problems. If you use your smartphone as a “security blanket” to relieve feelings of anxiety, loneliness, or awkwardness
in social situations, for example, you’ll succeed only in cutting yourself off further from people around you. Staring at your phone will deny
you the face-to-face interactions that can help to meaningfully connect you to others, alleviate anxiety, and boost your mood. 
In other words, the remedy you’re choosing for your anxiety (engaging with your smartphone), is actually making your anxiety worse.</pre>
